# Plaidypus-code-challenge

# Overview:
Create a two-page application using the Yelp Fusion API.
1. On the first page, you should be able to search for businesses in Naperville.
2. When you select a result, it should take you to a second page where you can see details about the business.
# Final Outlook:
# Technologies Used:
* JavaScript
* React
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Yelp Fusion API
# Project Overview
1. For this challenge I use Express.js for the back-end server. With this server, I use Yelp Fusion API to pass infomation endpoints that routes to the front-end.
2. I use React to render the endpoints, that was require to display infomation on the front-end. I also Install React-Bootstrap to make styling easier, and use App.css to render the layouts that fits best. I didn't want to go over and beyond, but the styling could be more efficient if needs to be.
# Instructions

2. Start the Express Server: 
cd into server

3. Start React client.
